# jukebox23
Developed by a team of two using a shared Github repo, this application serves as a digital Jukebox for the student center.

Students must create an account and log in to play songs. Once logged in, they can view available MP3 songs in a TableView, sorted by Title, Artist, and Time to play. By clicking column headings, songs can be sorted in ascending or descending order. The application also displays a PlayList showing the current song and upcoming songs in FIFO order. 

Logged-in students have the ability to queue up to three songs each day, resetting at midnight. The songs play audibly, ensuring students can enjoy their selections. Only those who are logged in can add songs to the PlayList.
